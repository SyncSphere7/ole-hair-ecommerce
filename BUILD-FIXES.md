## Why This Happened:

React/JSX requires special characters like apostrophes to be escaped when used in JSX text to avoid parsing issues. The ESLint rule `react/no-unescaped-entities` enforces this.

### Correct Usage:
```tsx
// ❌ Wrong
<p>We're happy to help!</p>

// ✅ Correct
<p>We&apos;re happy to help!</p>

// ✅ Alternative
<p>{"We're happy to help!"}</p>
```
