# Deployment Guide - Ole Hair E-Commerce

## ✅ Fixed Issues

The deployment errors have been resolved:
- ✅ Fixed smart quotes in FAQ page that caused syntax errors
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Ready to deploy

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (Automatic)

Since your GitHub repository is connected to Vercel, every time you push changes to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Build your project
3. Deploy the new version
4. Give you a live URL

### Current Status:
- **Repository:** https://github.com/SyncSphere7/ole-hair-ecommerce
- **Branch:** main
- **Latest Commit:** FAQ syntax fixes

### How Auto-Deployment Works:

```
Your Code (Local)
    ↓ git push
GitHub Repository
    ↓ (Vercel listens for changes)
Vercel Build & Deploy
    ↓
Live Website 🎉
```

## 🔄 Workflow for Future Changes

### Make Changes:
```bash
# 1. Edit files in VS Code

# 2. Test locally
npm run dev
# View at http://localhost:3000

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main

# 4. Vercel deploys automatically!
# Check deployment status at https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

## 🌐 Access Your Live Site

After deployment completes, your site will be available at:
- **Production URL:** https://ole-hair-ecommerce.vercel.app
- **Or custom domain** (if you set one up)

## 📊 Check Deployment Status

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard

3. See deployment status (Building/Ready/Failed)

### Option 2: GitHub

## 🐛 If Deployment Fails

### Check Build Logs:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click on the failed deployment
4. Read the error logs

### Common Issues:

#### TypeScript Errors

```

#### Missing Environment Variables
Add in Vercel dashboard:

git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push
```

```

## 🔧 Vercel Configuration

Your `vercel.json` is already set up with:
- Build command: `next build`
- Output directory: `.next`
- Install command: `npm install`

## 📝 Before First Deployment

Make sure these are ready:
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Syntax errors fixed
- [ ] Real product images uploaded
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel (when you get Pesapal keys)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)

## 🎉 Your Site is Ready!

Once Vercel finishes deploying:
1. You'll get a URL like: `https://ole-hair-ecommerce.vercel.app`
2. Share it with customers!
3. Any changes you push to GitHub go live automatically
