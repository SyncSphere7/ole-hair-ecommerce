# Vercel Cache Issue - SearchBar TypeScript Error

## The Problem

Vercel is showing a TypeScript error for code that doesn't exist in the current SearchBar component:
```
Error: Type error: Argument of type 'Product[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SetStateAction<never[]>'.
Line 47: setResults(sorted.slice(0, 6))
```

**But** the current SearchBar.tsx doesn't have this code anymore.

## Root Cause

Vercel is using a **cached version** of the code from a previous deployment.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Clear Vercel Build Cache (Recommended)

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (ole-hair-ecommerce)
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **Build & Development Settings**
5. Find **Build Cache** section
6. Click **Clear Build Cache**
7. Go to **Deployments** tab
8. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
9. Select **Use existing build cache: OFF**
10. Click **Redeploy**

### Option 2: Force Clean Build via Environment Variable

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new variable:
   - **Key**: `VERCEL_FORCE_BUILD`
   - **Value**: `true`
   - **Environment**: All (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Save
5. Trigger a new deployment (push to GitHub or manual redeploy)

### Option 3: Temporarily Change package.json

Add a dummy script to force cache invalidation:

```json
"scripts": {
  "force-rebuild": "echo 'Forcing rebuild'",
  ...
}
```

Commit and push this change.

### Option 4: Delete and Reconnect Project (Last Resort)

If all else fails:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Scroll to bottom
5. Click **Delete Project**
6. Reconnect your GitHub repo as a new project

## What We've Fixed

The actual code has been corrected:

**Before:**
```typescript
const [results, setResults] = useState<Product[]>(() => products.slice(0, 4))
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [results, setResults] = useState<Product[]>(products.slice(0, 4))
const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState<number>(-1)
```

## Commits Made

1. `1cb7d76` - Initial fix (removed lazy initializer)
2. `21e3cb6` - Added explicit type annotations
3. `1d24432` - Force rebuild commit

## Next Steps

1. Try Option 1 (Clear Build Cache in Vercel)
2. If that doesn't work, try Option 2
3. The code is correct - Vercel just needs to use the latest version

## Verification

After redeploying, check the build logs for:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Creating an optimized production build
```

The error should be gone!
